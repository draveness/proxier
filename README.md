# Proxier

Proxier is a better approach to expose applications in Kubernetes. It supports load balancing to a set of pods with weights and provides high-performance load balancing with nginx and HAProxy.

+ [x] supports canary deployment and load balancing by weight
+ [x] builtin load balancing applications support, ex: nginx and HAProxy
+ [ ] scales horizontally with pressure by default
